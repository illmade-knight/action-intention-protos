// This test is designed to run *after* the build and packaging script is complete.
// Its purpose is to verify that the final, flattened directory structure is correct
// and that the "real" idiomatic TS files can successfully import the generated proto files.

// 1. Import a "real" TS entity.
import { URN } from './envelope.js';

// 2. Import a generated proto directly to be certain the pathing works.
// THE FIX: Added the '.js' extension to the import path. This is required for
// proper module resolution in an ES Modules context.
