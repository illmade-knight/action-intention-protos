// and that the "real" idiomatic TS files can successfully import the generated proto files.

// 1. Import a "real" TS entity.
import { URN, mirrorTest } from './envelope.js';

// 2. Import a generated proto directly to be certain the pathing works.
// we keep this here because it fails directly if the import path is corrupted
